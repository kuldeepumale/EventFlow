## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Can users have multiple accounts?
A: Yes, but each phone number can only be registered once. Social login accounts with different emails are separate.

### Q: What happens if SMS fails?
A: In demo mode, OTP is shown in console. In production, implement retry mechanism and fallback methods.

### Q: Can deleted accounts be recovered?
A: No, deletion is permanent and irreversible. All data is immediately removed.

### Q: How long are sessions valid?
A: Tokens don't expire by default. Implement TTL in production for security.

### Q: Can users change their phone number?
A: Not currently. This would require building a number change flow with verification.

### Q: Is social login more secure than OTP?
A: Both are secure. OAuth delegates authentication to trusted providers. OTP requires SMS security.

### Q: What about GDPR compliance?
A: Account deletion feature provides GDPR-compliant data removal. Add privacy policy and cookie consent as needed.
